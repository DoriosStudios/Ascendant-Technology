# Ascendant Technology
An expansion add-on for UtilityCraft.

## Machine To-Do

First, I need to show a model of how these ideas works. Here's a quick example:
- 🟡 **Planned Idea:**
    - **Purpose:** *{The purpose of the item/block presented.}*
  	- **Operating Mode:** *{How does it works, on what circunstances, if there's a condition, etc.}*
  	- **[ Additional Fields ]**
    	- [ Optional Sub-Fields / Criteria ]

Now, here are the actual ideas:

- 🟡 **Network Center**
	- **Purpose:** Monitor and diagnose the energy network, providing a clear overview of production, consumption, and balance.
	- **Operating Mode:** Requires energy to operate. Automatically scans connected generators, machines, and storage blocks.
	- **Displays:**
		- Total energy production (e.g., +15.3 MDE/t)
		- Total energy consumption (e.g., −23.0 kDE/t)
		- Net balance (+ / −)
		- Number of connected generators and machines
		- Network status (Stable / Overloaded / Deficit)
	- **Notes:** Diagnostic only. Does not route, store, or redistribute energy.

- 🟡 **Catalyst Weaver**
	- **Purpose:** Advanced infusion machine capable of combining multiple catalysts and liquids into a single process.
	- **Operating Mode:** Uses up to 6 catalyst slots, 1 main input item, optional liquid interaction, and produces an output plus possible byproducts.
	- **Features:**
		- Supports fluid-based interference
		- Can generate residues, debris, or failed outputs
		- Designed for complex and unstable reactions
	- **Slots:**
		- Catalysts: Up to 6
		- Main Input: 1
		- Output: 1
		- Fluid Input: 1
		- Residue / Trash: 1
	- **Notes:** High-risk, high-reward processing. Not optimized for mass production.

- 🟡 **Energizer**
	- **Purpose:** Convert basic materials into their energized variants efficiently, focusing on large-scale production.
	- **Operating Mode:** High energy consumption. Direct conversion without catalysts.
	- **Primary Use Case:**
		- Iron Ingot → Energized Iron Ingot
	- **Additional Slots (Optional):**
		- Secondary item energization
		- Upgrade slot (efficiency / speed)
	- **Notes:** Bridges early UtilityCraft progression with Ascendant Technology content.

- 🟡 **Cryo Chamber**
	- **Purpose:** Control and stabilize temperature-sensitive processes required by advanced materials and reactions.
	- **Operating Mode:** Requires constant energy input to maintain low or stable temperatures.
	- **Use Cases:**
		- Prevent reaction failure
		- Stabilize volatile materials
		- Enable advanced alloy processing
	- **Notes:** Not a freezer. Intended exclusively for industrial and high-tier recipes.

- 🟡 **Cloner**
	- **Purpose:** Duplicate items based on predefined recipes, consuming energy and optional supporting resources.
	- **Operating Mode:** Continuous process with high energy demand.
	- **Characteristics:**
		- Recipe-based cloning (no direct duplication)
		- Designed for controlled reproduction of items
	- **Notes:** Suited for automation chains and late mid-game setups.

- 🟡 **Steam Generator / Gas Processor**
	- **Purpose:** Produce and manage Steam (Vapor) as a secondary processing element.
	- **Operating Mode:** Converts water and heat into Steam.
	- **Usage:**
		- Used as an auxiliary input for specific machines
		- Temporary processing boosts
	- **Notes:** Steam is a resource, not a power substitute. No complex gas piping required initially.

- 🟡 **Liquifier:**
  - **Purpose:** Convert solid items into their liquid equivalent for advanced processing.
  - **Operating Mode:** Consumes energy to melt or dissolve compatible items into fluids.
  - **Input:**
     - Solid item (ingots, crystals, special materials)
  - **Output:**
     - Liquid form of the item
  - **Features:**
     - Supports partial conversion (multiple items per bucket)
     - Compatible with fluid containers and fluid-capable machines
  - **Notes:** Processing-only machine. Does not mix, refine or infuse fluids.

- 🟡 Fluid Injector:
  - Purpose: Precisely inject fluids into machines that support liquid interaction.
  - Operating Mode: Transfers controlled fluid amounts per operation.
  - Features:
     - Adjustable injection rate
     - Prevents fluid waste and overflows
  - Notes: Utility block. Not a processor or storage unit.

- 🟡 Residue Processor:
  - Purpose: Process debris, trash and byproducts generated by complex machines.
  - Operating Mode: Consumes energy to recycle or neutralize residues.
  - Outputs:
     - Reclaimed materials
     - Neutral waste
     - Heat or minor byproducts
  - Notes: Adds value to failure and leftovers without guaranteeing returns.

- 🟡 Dimensional Teleporter:
  - Purpose: Allow controlled teleportation between dimensions.
  - Operating Mode: Requires a linked core and high energy cost per activation.
  - Features:
     - One-way or two-way linking
     - High activation cooldown
  - Restrictions:
     - No instant spam teleport
     - Requires physical installation in each dimension
  - Notes: Late-game infrastructure, not fast travel replacement.

- 🟡 Item Energizer Pad:
  - Purpose: Temporarily energize tools or items while placed on the pad.
  - Operating Mode: Continuous energy drain while an item is active.
  - Effects:
     - Increased efficiency
     - Faster operation
     - Temporary bonuses
  - Notes: Effects wear off after removal. No permanent upgrades.

- 🟡 Laser Barrier:
  - Purpose: Create energy-based barriers for protection or area control.
  - Operating Mode: Consumes energy to maintain an active barrier field.
  - Features:
     - Configurable size
     - Damage or blocking mode
  - Notes: Defensive utility. Not intended for mob farming.

- 🟡 Portable Power Cell:
  - Purpose: Store energy in a movable item format.
  - Operating Mode: Can be charged in machines and carried by the player.
  - Features:
     - Multiple capacity tiers
     - Supports machine fueling or temporary tool usage
  - Notes: Storage only. No generation or routing logic.
