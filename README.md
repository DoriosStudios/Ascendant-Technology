# Ascendant Technology
An expansion add-on for UtilityCraft.

## Machine To-Do

- 🟡 **Network Center**
	- **Purpose:** Monitor and diagnose the energy network, providing a clear overview of production, consumption, and balance.
	- **Operating Mode:** Requires energy to operate. Automatically scans connected generators, machines, and storage blocks.
	- **Displays:**
		- Total energy production (e.g., +15.3 MDE/t)
		- Total energy consumption (e.g., −23.0 kDE/t)
		- Net balance (+ / −)
		- Number of connected generators and machines
		- Network status (Stable / Overloaded / Deficit)
	- **Notes:** Diagnostic only. Does not route, store, or redistribute energy.

- 🟡 **Catalyst Weaver**
	- **Purpose:** Advanced infusion machine capable of combining multiple catalysts and liquids into a single process.
	- **Operating Mode:** Uses up to 6 catalyst slots, 1 main input item, optional liquid interaction, and produces an output plus possible byproducts.
	- **Features:**
		- Supports fluid-based interference
		- Can generate residues, debris, or failed outputs
		- Designed for complex and unstable reactions
	- **Slots:**
		- Catalysts: Up to 6
		- Main Input: 1
		- Output: 1
		- Fluid Input: 1
		- Residue / Trash: 1
	- **Notes:** High-risk, high-reward processing. Not optimized for mass production.

- 🟡 **Energizer**
	- **Purpose:** Convert basic materials into their energized variants efficiently, focusing on large-scale production.
	- **Operating Mode:** High energy consumption. Direct conversion without catalysts.
	- **Primary Use Case:**
		- Iron Ingot → Energized Iron Ingot
	- **Additional Slots (Optional):**
		- Secondary item energization
		- Upgrade slot (efficiency / speed)
	- **Notes:** Bridges early UtilityCraft progression with Ascendant Technology content.

- 🟡 **Cryo Chamber**
	- **Purpose:** Control and stabilize temperature-sensitive processes required by advanced materials and reactions.
	- **Operating Mode:** Requires constant energy input to maintain low or stable temperatures.
	- **Use Cases:**
		- Prevent reaction failure
		- Stabilize volatile materials
		- Enable advanced alloy processing
	- **Notes:** Not a freezer. Intended exclusively for industrial and high-tier recipes.

- 🟡 **Cloner**
	- **Purpose:** Duplicate items based on predefined recipes, consuming energy and optional supporting resources.
	- **Operating Mode:** Continuous process with high energy demand.
	- **Characteristics:**
		- Recipe-based cloning (no direct duplication)
		- Designed for controlled reproduction of items
	- **Notes:** Suited for automation chains and late mid-game setups.

- 🟡 **Steam Generator / Gas Processor**
	- **Purpose:** Produce and manage Steam (Vapor) as a secondary processing element.
	- **Operating Mode:** Converts water and heat into Steam.
	- **Usage:**
		- Used as an auxiliary input for specific machines
		- Temporary processing boosts
	- **Notes:** Steam is a resource, not a power substitute. No complex gas piping required initially.
